# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer

The middleware function is different than normal controller because it takes in the request and hands it off to someone else. It is kinda of like a mailman gets the mail and send it to someone else

# Teacher Feedback

Love the analogy, the mailman would not **respond** to the mail!
